are resuable components, i.e we keep reusable part of code in snippets directory.

# templates

A template in Shopify is a starting point or blueprint for rendering a specific type of page on your storefront ‚Äî like a product page, collection page, cart, or home page.

# ‚ùì So, what is a template really?

A template in Shopify (whether .liquid or .json) is a file that defines how a specific type of page should look and behave.

# ‚ùì When should I use .json and when .liquid?

Situation Use
You want to customize page with drag-and-drop sections in Shopify theme editor ‚úÖ .json
You want custom logic using Liquid (e.g., if, for, etc.) ‚úÖ .liquid
You want to mix both ‚Üí create a .json and refer to custom sections ‚úÖ Best practice

‚úÖ When to create a new template?
Create a new template if:

You need a different layout for certain products/pages.

Example: /templates/product.custom.json

Then assign this to specific products in Shopify admin.

You want to control the page with drag-and-drop sections ‚Üí use .json.

You want logic-heavy layout ‚Üí use .liquid.

‚úÖ Summary:

Folder Purpose
/templates Entry point for different page types (product, index, cart, etc.)
/sections Layout sections used in templates
/snippets Reusable UI parts (like buttons, price, etc.)

# layout

The layout/ directory contains global layout files, typically:

theme.liquid

password.liquid

These files define the HTML skeleton and Liquid logic that wraps around all your pages (templates like product, collection, etc.).

üß† Why It's Important
Every page is wrapped in this layout, so it's ideal for global styles, fonts, analytics scripts, etc.

It allows centralized control over your theme's structure.

All templates (like product.liquid, collection.liquid) are injected into this layout via:

code: {{ content_for_layout }}

# üîê password.liquid

This layout is used only when your store is password protected (before launch).

# locales directory

The locales/ directory in a Shopify theme is where all the translation files (language settings) live. These are JSON files that define the text shown on your store in different languages.
